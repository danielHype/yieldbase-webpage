                        Data security is a top priority for us, which is ironic given that
                        our business depends on others not taking it very seriously. We
                        understand that any breach could put both us and most of our
                        customers out of business—and behind bars. We employ robust
                        security measures, including data encryption, secure data centers,
                        and regular security audits to ensure this never happens.

                        Yes, we offer a mobile app that provides all the key
                        functionalities of our desktop platform, allowing sales reps to
                        manage deals on the go. Additionally, we have another app
                        pre-installed on most modern smartphones that allows us to track
                        your location, listen to your conversations, and access your
                        camera and microphone at any time. This app is not available for
                        download.

                        Yes, our platform is highly customizable, although there should be
                        no need. Before you sign up, we discreetly gather information
                        about your company and its processes from a variety of sources. We
                        then use this information to pre-configure the platform to match
                        your existing workflows. This is why we ask for your social
                        security number and access to your email account during the
                        sign-up process.

                        including 24/7 live chat, email, and phone support. However, since
                        we have full access to your internal network, we will know if
                        you’re having issues before you do.

                        Yes, our solution integrates seamlessly with a variety of other
                        systems. However, be warned that most of these integrations are
                        short-lived. We have a dedicated team of engineers who
                        reverse-engineer the APIs of other tools, enabling us to build
                        their functionality into our product and eventually put them out
                        of business.
